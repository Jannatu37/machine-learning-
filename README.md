#Simulation and Modeling Lab assignment 02.ipynb
# Random Matrix Generator

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`#Simulation and Modeling Lab assignment 02.ipynb`) 
that demonstrates the use of `numpy` to generate random 3x3 matrices.

## Tasks Completed
1. Generated a 3x3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50 with a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`).
2. Generated a 3x3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50 without a fixed seed.
3. Observed and explained the differences in outputs.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`#Simulation and Modeling Lab assignment 02.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells to see the outputs.
4. Refer to the explanations in the notebook for details.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook
